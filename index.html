        Section 1: "Karnataka State"
    </h1>
    <p>
        Karnataka (/kərˈnɑːtəkə/; ISO: Karnāṭaka, Kannada pronunciation: [kəɾˈnɑːʈəkɑ]) is a state in the south western region of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act. Originally known as the State of Mysore /maɪˈsɔːr/, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The state corresponds to the Carnatic region. Its capital and largest city is Bangalore.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. It is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other 4 southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of 191,791 square kilometres (74,051 sq mi), or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India.[10] It is the sixth largest Indian state by area.[10] With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth largest state by population, comprising 31 districts. Kannada, one of the classical languages of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include Urdu, Konkani, Marathi, Tulu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kodava and Beary. Karnataka also contains some of the only villages in India where Sanskrit is primarily spoken.[11][12][13]
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu, meaning "elevated land". Karu Nadu may also be read as karu, meaning "black" and nadu, meaning "region", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.[14]
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The economy of Karnataka is the sixth-largest of any Indian state with ₹16.65 trillion (US$220 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of ₹226,000 (US$3,000).[3] Karnataka has the nineteenth highest ranking among Indian states in Human Development Index.[5]

        <h2>
            Section 2 “This is Karnataka State pre-history”
        </h2>
   <p>
    Karnataka's pre-history goes back to a paleolithic hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region.[15] Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilisation ca. 3300 BCE.[16][17]
   </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka. Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas, marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty, founded by Mayurasharma, had its capital at Banavasi;[18][19] the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital.[20][21]
    </p>
     <br>

     <p>
        These were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi.[22][23] These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas,[24][25] the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta[26][27] and the Western Chalukya Empire,[28][29] which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka. The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of the 12th century.[30][31] Parts of modern-day Southern Karnataka (Gangavadi) were occupied by the Chola Empire at the turn of the 11th century.[32] The Cholas and the Hoysalas fought over the region in the early 12th century before it eventually came under Hoysala rule.[32]
    </p>
     <br>
     <p>
        At the turn of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the emergence of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture.[33][34][35][36] The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. Under the rule of Krishnadevaraya, a distinct form of literature and architecture evolved.[37][38] The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.[39][40]In 1537, Kempe Gowda I, a chieftain of the Vijayanagara Empire, widely held as the founder of modern Bangalore, built a fort and established the area around it as Bengaluru Pete.[41]
    </p>
     <br>
     <p>
        In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota.[42] The Bijapur Sultanate, which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century.[43][44] The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style.[45] During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette, Goa,[46] while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to North Canara and South Canara, especially from Bardes, Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese.[47]
    </p>
     <br>
     <p>
        In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maratha Empire, the British, and other powers.[48] In the south, the Mysore Kingdom, a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent.[49] With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haidar Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tipu Sultan.[50] To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tipu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj in 1799.[51] The Kingdom of Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars and Mysore remained a princely state under the British Raj.[50]

  <h1>
    Section 3 “This is Karnataka State three principal geographical zones ”
  </h1>
  <p>
    The state has three principal geographical zones:
    <br>
    1. The coastal region of Karavali and Tulu Nadu
    <br>
   2. The hilly Malenadu region comprising the Western Ghats
   <br>
   3. The Bayaluseeme region comprising the plains of the Deccan Plateau
  </p>
  <br>
  <!-- <ol>

      The coastal region of Karavali and Tulu Nadu
    </li>
    <li>
      The hilly Malenadu region comprising the Western Ghats
    </li>
    <li>
      The Bayaluseeme region comprising the plains of the Deccan Plateau
    </li>
</ol> -->
  <p>
    The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is the second-largest arid region in India.[57] The highest point in Karnataka is the Mullayanagiri hills in Chikmagalur district which has an altitude of 1,925 metres (6,316 ft). The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha and Tungabhadra in North Karnataka, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in South Karnataka. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the Bay of Bengal. Other prominent rivers such as the Sharavati in Shimoga and Netravati in Dakshina Kannada flow westward, reaching the sea at the Arabian Sea. A large number of dams and reservoirs are constructed across these rivers which richly add to the irrigation and hydroelectricity power generation capacities of the state.[citation needed]
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations[58] – the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses,[59] the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series,[60] the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits.[61] Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols.[58][62] Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.[62]
</p>
<br>
<p>
    About 38,284 km2 (14,782 sq mi) of Karnataka (i.e. 16% of the state's geographic area) is covered by forests.[63][64] The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests.[63] The percentage of forested area is slightly less than the all-India average of about 23%,[63] and significantly less than the 33% prescribed in the National Forest Policy.[65]
